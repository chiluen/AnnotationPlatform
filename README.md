#Develop instruction

# Frontend
- I already create all component's and container's folder for development
- Recommend develop workflow:
    - **First use "yarn install-all" at /AnnotationPlatform to install all the package**
    - **First please use "yarn fronend" at /AnnotationPlatform to open the testing website, it can save you tons of time**
    - Create the components at src/components/... folder, then combine it at src/containers/... , then it can be render to the website
    - If you want to test some data, I recommand you to create some fake data in src/test_data.js, then import the data to where you want(make sure that data format should be JSON format, because API use JSON format to transfer data)
- Notice
    - If you want to use Icon, please use material-UI [LINK](https://mui.com/zh/material-ui/material-icons/)
